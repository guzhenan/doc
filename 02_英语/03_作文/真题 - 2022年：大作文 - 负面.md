	This is a simple but enlightening drawing. In which, there are two youngsters, standing in front of a notice board and discussing whether to participate in a lecture or not. The left girl deems that it is not necessary to go for the lecture since it is not related to their major. On the contrary, her partner supposes it is helpful to learn something.

    Such a scene above, apparently, can be associated with two totally different attitudes toward studying. From my point of view, successful people are characterized by their various excellent qualities, such as diligenece, confidence and strong desire to learn diffience field. However, admittedly, in reality, a host of young people who tend to focus merely on their majors or fields, ignoring the significance of broadening their horizons.

    This phenomenon is particularly worth attention for the reason that such superficial and short-sighted behavior has constituted an obstacle which hinders their progress and growth. Therefore, I am convinced that it is not advisable for teenagers to limit themselves in acquiring the professional knowledge. Everyone is supposed to bear in mind that rich knowledge can be likened to a ladder, leading to human progress.

    As a college student who is preparing for the postgraduate examination, I do my utmost to master my professional knowledge and skills firstly. Meanwhile, in the spare time, I am fond of attending diverse lectures or reading extensively in library, which can bring me unique experience, inspire my passion for learning, and help me grow comprehensively.
