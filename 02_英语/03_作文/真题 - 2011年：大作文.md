	This is a simple but enlightening drawing.Inside this drawing,there are two young guys sitting in the boat, enjoying their fruitful trip and watching them book. However, a host of trash can be observed in the river.

    Such a scene apparently can be associated with an increasing number of news that show the environment has been destroyed by endless trash in reality.This phenomenon is particularly worse concerning since it is our no limited action that causes such things to happen.As a matter of fact,if we do not stop such things happening, we will lose our environment forever.

    Accordingly, it is advisable for us to explain why this problem is worse concerning that it enables people to know the importance of the environment.First,if we endless make trash in the river, which will cause the safety problem with these people living in the river around. Besides, if this trash can not be clear immediately,this trash will stay in river and make such a beautiful scene no longer exist.
