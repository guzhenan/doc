	This is a simple but enlightening and thought-provoking drawing. Inside this picture, there is a dragon-boat race, with a host of villagers, standing around and cheering up. Meanwhile, a grandpa is talking with his wife, "The dragon boat race in our village is becoming increasingly wonderful !"

    China, as an ancient country of civilization, is characterized by it time-honored history and diverse cultural tradition, such as Mid-Autumn Festival, the Dragon Boat Festival and the Spring Festival. In order to preserve these cultural heritage, Chinese people, particularly residents in the rural areas, still hold a variety of traditional ceremonies or activies.

    This phenomenon is particularly worth attention for the reason that these activies can bring us festive atmosphere, inspire our passion toward traditional culture, and help us learn about our motherland`s history better. A case in point is the dragon boat race in the picture. It is this race that enable a large number of youngsters to know Qu Yuan and his love for the nation. Accordlingly, from my point of view, traditional culture can be likened to a bridge, linking the past to today.

    As a youngster, I am convinced that society as a whole should foster a positive atmosphere to encourage and educate all citizens to participate in traditional cultural activies. Besides, everyone is supposed to bear in mind that our history and culture is the root of our nation.
