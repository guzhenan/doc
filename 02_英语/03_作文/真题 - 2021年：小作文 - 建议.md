Dear Tom,

    As your friend,I`m quite pleased to hear that you intend to find a job in China , and today I am writing for the purpose of making several suggestions.

   To begin with, as my point of view, it is advisable for you to look for a job in Beijing.Because Beijing, as the captial, is characterized by its a large number of employment opportunities. In addition, you are supposed to apply for the position of Enlish teacher at a training organization. Since, compared with others, you, as a native English speaker, own a host of advantages and you have worked as a part-time English teacher.

    Finally, I believe that your excellent teaching will bring Chinese student efficiency,inspire their passion for learning, and help them speak English fluently.if you have any other ideas of requirements, please feel free to inform me.

                                                                   Your sincerely,
                                                                            Li Ming.
