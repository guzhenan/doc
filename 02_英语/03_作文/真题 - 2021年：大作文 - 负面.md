	This is a simple but enlightening drawing,in which there is a lovely and cute boy,with a little disappointment on his face, complaining "I want to learn the traditional opera,but a host of my classmates feel that it is boring".Then,his father encourages him,"It is significant for you to be keen on it".

    Such a scene or the father`s encouragement ,apparently, can be associated with the significance of sticking to one`s dream. As my point of view, successful individuals are characterized by their various excellent qualities, such as confidence,optimism and independent thinking. However, in reality, a large number of youngsters tend to be influenced by other`s opinions and even give up what they really want to pursue.

    This phenomenon is particularly worth attention for the reason that these young people care too much about others` comments, ignoring the importance of persisting in their own thoughts. Unfortunately,this nagative state of mind has constituted an obstacle that hinders their long-term growth and progress.

    I, as a college student, deem that it is advisable for young people to do what we like, which can bring us power, inspire our passion for striving, and help us eventually achieve our dreams in the end. Meanwhile, everyone is supposed to bear in mind that it is our tremendous effort rather than others` comments that enables us to embrace success and promising future. After all, interest is the best teacher.
