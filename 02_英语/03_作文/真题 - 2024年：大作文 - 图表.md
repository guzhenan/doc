	In the drawing, there are several youngsters, doing sports in the park with smiles on their faces. One of them comments,"This nearby newly-built park is wonderful". Meanwhile, a chart can be noticed, which displays that from 2020 to 2022, the number of parks increased sharply, from 406 to 670.

    Such a scene, apparently, can be associated with the increasingly significant role of parks in people`s daily life. Undoubtedly, in recent years, China has been characterized by its boom and prosperity in economy, which has enabled the government to possess extra financial budget

    This phenomenon is particularly worth attention for the reason that these parks can bring residents places to relax and do exercise, inspire their passion for life, and help them stay healthy physically and mentally. A typical example is myself. As a senior who is preparing for the postgraduate examination, I get up early every day and take exercise for half an hour in the park. It is this positive habit that enables me to be efficient in learning.

    Accordingly, it is advisable for the government to build more parks for the public. Besides, society as a whole should foster a nice atmosphere to educate and encourage citizens to protect the beautiful environment of parks.
