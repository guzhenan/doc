	This drawing,apparently,can be associated with diverse factors that influence a college student`s choice of course. To be specific, inside this picture,a youngster is sitting in front of a course selection system,looking at the screen, with two kind of elements in his head: one group includes the latest knowledge and emphasis on innovation, the other includes less difficulities in passing the test and less assignments.

    Such a scene above is particularly worth concering for the reason that in reality, certain students may focus only on the so-called "easy", ignoring what knowledge they can learn from.As a matter of fact, their superficial and short-sighted behavior has constituted an obstacle that hamper their long-term growth and progress.

    Accordingly,I am convinced that it is exceedingly necessary for college students to take challenging course with latest knowledge.It is these course that enable teenagers to acquire the competitive edge and keep up with the fast pace of society development.

    As a senior who is preparing for the national entrance examination for the postgraduate studies, I prefer challenging couses,which can bring me power to strive, inspire my passion for research and help me broaden my horizons.
